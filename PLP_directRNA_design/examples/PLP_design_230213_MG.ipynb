    "This notebook takes you through the process of design of padlock probes for direct RNA detection using the Home Made dRNA protocol from the Nilsson lab. \n",
    "\n",
    "**As most of the code we write, we suggest you to run this in Linux. Surely `ClustalW2` and `cutadapt` can be run on Windows or Mac, but try this at your own risk and only if you vaguely know what you're doing**\n",
    "\n",
    "The process works roughly as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The user inputs a list of genes, a transcriptome and some other parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The `extract_and_align` function goes through the list of genes and extracts the corresponding mRNA sequences for all the isoforms from the transcriptome. All the mRNA sequences corresponding to a gene are aligned using ClustalW2 and the common regions are extracted. From these common regions, all the k-mers (whose length is specified by the user in the `plp_length` variable) that are suitable for binding a probe are extracted. This selection takes into account GC content and other variables determined by the RNA ligation chemistry. At this step you can also inspect the returned variables to figure out whether this step failed for some of your genes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Of all the suitable k-mers (normally a large number per gene) only a subset is sampled from random non-overlapping positions on the mRNA molecule. The size of this subset is specified by the user in the variable `number_of_seqs`. The sequences in the subset will undergo the downstream step. **See note on computation time to optimise this number according to your needs**\n",
    "\n",
    "4) The subsetted sequences will go a step of **specificicy check to remove off-targets**. Each sequence is searched back against the reference transcriptome, and any match that could potentially give spurious signal is excluded. This requires the user to introduce a mismatch tolerance parameter, for our current ligase we normally exclude any off-target with a mismatch up to 6nt. This parameter can be modified by the variable `mismatches`. We suggest not to change it and act conservatively. Often it's just impossible to design probes for closely related sequences (ie. recent paralogues) with the current detection chemistry.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) At this point, the probe design pipeline might have failed for some genes, most likely because of a too low `number_of_seqs` value, which produced few sequences to map, or maybe because the mapped sequences are not unique enough in the transcriptome and pick off targets. You can inspect how your search went following the steps in the **\"Check the amount of specific sequences for each gene\"** section.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Very often, at this stage is advisable to perform a second run on the failed genes, trying to increase the `number_of_seqs` value. Check the paragraph \"RUN2...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Suitable and unique targets collected from both runs are finally merged into a single table. This table is then used for the design of probes, in the `Assign Gene to Barcode` section. Refer to that section for more specific instructions.\n",

It runs by default as a multi-thread search, but it's still the slowest step in the pipeline, especially when working with large gene lists. This is the reason why we implemented a 2-step search based on 2 consecutive runs. You can of course work straight in searching a large number of `number_of_seqs` from the first run, but this will considerably slow down your search."
