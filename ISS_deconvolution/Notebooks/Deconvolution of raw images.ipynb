    "\n",
    "Image deconvolution is performed on GPU using `flowdec` https://github.com/hammerlab/flowdec\n",
    "\n",
    "**To run image deconvolution using this notebook, you need a CUDA-compatible GPU with functional NVIDIA drivers, cuDNN, etc... and a functional Tensoflow installation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To do image deconvolution, you will first need to know some parameters about your microscope. Take some time to carefully read the guide below and to collect some information before you attempt image deconvolution. This will save you a lot of computing time and frustration: using the wrong parameters will result in imaging artifacts, so be careful!\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters will be used to create a synthetic point-spread function (PSF). If you don't know what a PSF is and why it is important, please read here: ​​https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_spread_function\n",

    "This function organises the raw images from a Leica experiment according to Cycle, Region, Tile, Channel, arranges them in individual 3D stacks, deconvolves each stack and save its maximum projection (default).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The function mirrors the workflow of the `leica_mipping` function from the `ISS_preprocessing` module in the sense that organise the files in a similar way but performs a deconvolution before the maximum projection.

    "\n",
    "`input_dirs`: This will be a list of the complete paths to the folders containing your imaging cycles. The folders need to be specified in the right order (ie. the first element of the list will be the folder where the first cycle of imaging is saved, and so on) The elements need to be separated by commas. The format for this variable is a `lst` of `str`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`output_dir_prefix`:  This will be the path where you want the preprocessing output to be saved. Ideally, this should be associated with some type of unique project identifier. The format of this variable is `str`. In case multiple regions are being processed, the funcion will behave differently depending whether a trailing slash `/` is included or not in `output_location`: \n",

    "- if a trailing slash is omitted, then `output_location` will be updated at each region iteration, and each one of the scanned regions will end up in a different `output_location` named as `output_location_R1`,`output_location_R2`, etc...\n",

    "`image_dimensions`: this is a list of 2 elements [x,y], specifying the x and y sizes of each image (default=[2048, 2048])\n",

If `chunk_size` is unspecified, the function will try to load the entire stack. If your kernel crashes before performing any actual work, the most likely cause is that you are running out of memory.\n",
    "The solution to this RAM shortage is to chunk the stack in sub-stacks, deconvolve each independently and merge them afterwards. A typical `chunk_size` value that works for most GPU is [512,512] in XY. Z is automatically extracted from the data. If your GPU is very small you can try with [256,256] or even [128,128].\n",
